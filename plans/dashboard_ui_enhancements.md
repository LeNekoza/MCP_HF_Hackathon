Here's a Markdown file content that clearly outlines the new plan for updating the dashboard interface:

# 🛠️ Dashboard UI Enhancement Plan

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this update is to improve the **Dashboard User Interface** by making it **functional and interactive**, moving beyond the current static layout.

## 📌 Scope

✅ Focus **only** on the **dashboard** section
❌ **Do not** touch or modify the **chatbot** section in any way

## 🧩 Tasks

1. **Identify static elements** in `hospital_dashboard.html` that should have interactive behavior (e.g., tables, charts, filters).
2. **Apply functional enhancements** using Python (`interface.py`) and minimal JavaScript as needed.
3. **Connect backend data** to dynamically populate dashboard elements (e.g., metrics, charts).
4. **Add necessary scripts and styles**:

   * JavaScript files → `@/static/js/`
   * CSS files → `@/static/css/`

## 🗂️ Files to Modify

* `interface.py`
* `hospital_dashboard.html`
* (Optional) Add JS/CSS in `@/static/js/` or `@/static/css/`

## ✅ Deliverables

* A working dashboard with live, functional components
* No visual or logical impact on chatbot features
* Clean and maintainable code with separation of concerns

# 💬 Chatbot Loader Integration Plan

## 🎯 Objective

Enhance the **user experience** in the Gradio chatbot by adding a **visual loader** that indicates when the system is processing a request after a user sends a message.

## 🧩 Problem

Currently, there's **no feedback** after a user sends a message. This can cause confusion, as users cannot tell if the system is fetching a response or is unresponsive.

## ✅ Solution

Implement a **loading indicator** that:

* Appears immediately after the user submits a message
* Displays dynamic status text such as:

  * *“Thinking...”*
  * *“Querying the database...”*
  * *“Loading...”*
* Disappears once the LLM response is received
* Then shows the actual chatbot reply

## 🗂️ Files to Edit (inside `src/` folder)

* `src/interface.py` – Update backend logic to trigger the loader state
* `src/chatbot.html` – Modify frontend layout if needed
* `src/static/js/` – Add supporting JavaScript for loader behavior
* `src/static/css/` – Add custom styles for the loader appearance

## 💡 Notes

* Loader should be minimal and non-blocking
* Ensure it works across both slow and fast responses
* Do **not** alter chatbot logic or interfere with LLM interaction

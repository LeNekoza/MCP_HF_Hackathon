# Hospital AI Helper Aid (H.A.H.A)

## üöÄ Overview

The Hospital AI Helper Aid (H.A.H.A) is an advanced AI-powered application designed to assist medical professionals and patients within a hospital environment. It features a sophisticated chat interface for medical consultations, real-time access to hospital data through database integration, and an interactive dashboard for visualizing key hospital metrics. The system leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for intelligent data handling and integrates with powerful large language models like Nebius Llama 3.3 70B.

The main interface and application logic are orchestrated within [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py).

## ‚ú® Features

*   **AI-Powered Medical Consultations:** Provides medical information, guidance, and advice through an intelligent chat interface.
*   **Real-time Database Integration:** Connects to a hospital database (Neon PostgreSQL) to fetch and display live data on patients, rooms, staff, and inventory. This is primarily handled by `src/services/advanced_database_mcp.py` (as referenced in [`docs/project/AI_DATABASE_INTEGRATION_FLOW.md`](docs/project/AI_DATABASE_INTEGRATION_FLOW.md)) and integrated into the chat flow in [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py).
*   **Interactive Dashboard:** A modern, responsive dashboard built with Gradio, showcasing vital hospital statistics and data visualizations.
*   **Natural Language Queries:** Users can query the database using plain English; the system fetches relevant data which is then analyzed by the AI.
*   **AI-Enhanced Data Analysis:** Database results are processed by the AI to provide contextual insights, summaries, and professional formatting, as seen in the `stream_response` function within [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py).
*   **LaTeX Formatting:** Medical values (e.g., blood pressure, BMI, dosages) are rendered using LaTeX for clarity and professionalism, facilitated by [`src/utils/latex_formatter.py`](src/utils/latex_formatter.py).
*   **Streaming Responses & Loading Indicators:** Enhanced user experience with real-time streaming of AI responses and dynamic loading indicators (e.g., "ü§î Thinking...", "üóÑÔ∏è Querying the database...") during processing, implemented in the `stream_response` function in [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py).
*   **Contextual Chat History:** Maintains conversation context for seamless interactions, managed within the Gradio interface logic.
*   **Secure Configuration:** Manages sensitive credentials securely using environment variables (`.env`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Python
*   **Web Interface:** Gradio
*   **AI Model Provider:** Nebius (specifically `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon)
*   **Core Logic:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, custom AI model handlers.
*   **Styling:** Custom CSS for a modern hospital theme.

## üì¶ MCP Tools/Servers

**üè∑Ô∏è Track 1: MCP Server / Tool**

This project implements a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Database Integration** to enable the AI assistant to interact with a live hospital database.
*   **Core Engine:** The integration involves components like [`src/models/mcp_handler.py`](src/models/mcp_handler.py) and `src/services/advanced_database_mcp.py`.
    *   **Intent Recognition:** The system parses user queries to determine if they relate to database information (e.g., patient lookup, room status).
    *   **Data Retrieval & AI Analysis:** Instead of directly generating SQL and returning raw data, the system fetches data based on the user's intent. This data is then passed to the AI model along with the original user query. The AI analyzes the data, provides insights, and formats the response professionally. This flow is detailed in [`docs/project/AI_DATABASE_INTEGRATION_FLOW.md`](docs/project/AI_DATABASE_INTEGRATION_FLOW.md) and implemented in the `stream_response` and [`handle_ai_response`](src/components/interface.py) functions within [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py).
*   **Seamless Chatbot Integration:** The main interface in [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py) automatically detects if a user's query should involve database interaction, fetches data, and then uses the AI to present a comprehensive, analyzed response.

## üé® Custom Gradio Components

The user interface is built using Gradio, with several custom components and layouts defined primarily in [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py):
*   **Main Dashboard (`gr.Blocks`):** The entire application is structured within `gr.Blocks`, using `gr.Row`, `gr.Column`, and `gr.HTML` to create a bespoke layout.
*   **Custom HTML Sections:**
    *   **Headers & Navigation:** Includes an assistant header, dashboard title, controls (like a "Helpline" button), and navigation buttons ("Dashboard", "Data") created using `gr.HTML`.
    *   **Dashboard & Data Views:** Specific sections like `#dashboard-section` and `#data-section` (with tabs for Patients, Staff, Rooms) are rendered using `gr.HTML`, allowing for custom styling and structure beyond standard Gradio components.
*   **Styled Chat Interface (`gr.Chatbot`):** The chatbot is configured with specific properties (`type="messages"`, `layout="bubble"`) and custom CSS for appearance.
*   **Dynamic Loading Indicators:** Implemented within the `stream_response` function in [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py). These are HTML snippets injected into the chat history to show messages like "ü§î Thinking...", "üóÑÔ∏è Querying the database...", providing real-time feedback.
*   **CSS Styling:** Extensive custom CSS is loaded via the [`load_modern_hospital_css`](src/components/interface.py) function (which reads from [`static/css/styles.css`](static/css/styles.css)) to achieve a unique "modern hospital" theme, overriding default Gradio styles.

### üõ†Ô∏è Integration Instructions

To integrate this MCP server with SSE-compatible clients (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, Cline), add the following to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gradio": {
      "url": "http://localhost:7860/gradio_api/mcp/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### üß™ Experimental stdio Support

For clients limited to standard input/output protocols, first ensure Node.js is installed, then integrate using:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gradio": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:7860/gradio_api/mcp/sse",
        "--transport",
        "sse-only"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This setup ensures broader compatibility and flexibility across various client types and integration scenarios.

## ü§ñ AI Agent

The primary AI agent powering the medical assistant is the **`meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`** model, accessed via the Nebius API.
*   **Integration:** Managed through the [`NebiusModel`](src/models/nebius_model.py) class, which is initialized and used in [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py). Details of this integration can also be found in [`docs/setup/NEBIUS_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/setup/NEBIUS_INTEGRATION.md).
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   **Medical Consultation:** Answers health-related questions and provides medical information.
    *   **Chat Completion:** Engages in natural conversations, maintaining context.
    *   **Data Analysis & Presentation:** When provided with data from the hospital database (via the `stream_response` logic in [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py)), the AI analyzes this information in conjunction with the user's query. It then generates a comprehensive response including structured data, medical analysis, LaTeX formatting, and recommendations. This process is outlined in the `enhanced_prompt` logic within `stream_response` and [`handle_ai_response`](src/components/interface.py).
    *   **Streaming Responses:** Supports streaming of responses for an interactive user experience.
*   **Configuration:** Model parameters like temperature and max tokens are handled within the AI interaction functions in [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py).

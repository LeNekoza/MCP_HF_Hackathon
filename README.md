# Health AI Hospital Aid (H.A.H.A)


## üåü Inspiration

The inspiration for H.A.H.A. stems from the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when hospitals across the globe faced overwhelming pressure and resource mismanagement. We remember vividly how many medical institutions struggled to allocate and monitor critical supplies like oxygen bags, beds, and staff in real time. This project is our response to that crisis ‚Äî aiming to empower hospitals with intelligent, data-driven tools to streamline operations, enhance patient care, and ensure that vital resources are used efficiently during both everyday operations and emergencies.

## üöÄ Overview

The Health AI Hospital Aid (H.A.H.A) is an advanced AI-powered application designed to assist medical professionals and patients within a hospital environment. It features a sophisticated chat interface for medical consultations, real-time access to hospital data through database integration, and an interactive dashboard for visualizing key hospital metrics and forecast data. The system leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for intelligent data handling and integrates with powerful large language models like Nebius Llama 3.3 70B.

The main interface and application logic are orchestrated within [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py).

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Medical Consultations:** Provides medical information, guidance, and advice through an intelligent chat interface.
- **Real-time Database Integration:** Connects to a hospital database (Neon PostgreSQL) to fetch and display live data on patients, rooms, staff, and inventory. This is primarily handled by `src/services/advanced_database_mcp.py` and integrated into the chat flow in [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py).
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A modern, responsive dashboard built with Gradio, designed to showcase key hospital statistics and predictive analytics. Users can inquire about the dashboard content by tagging @analysis when asking questions.
- **Natural Language Queries:** Users can query the database using plain English; the system fetches relevant data which is then analyzed by the AI.
- **AI-Enhanced Data Analysis:** Database results are processed by the AI to provide contextual insights, summaries, and professional formatting, as seen in the `stream_response` function within [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py).
- **LaTeX Formatting:** Medical values (e.g., blood pressure, BMI, dosages) are rendered using LaTeX for clarity and professionalism, facilitated by [`src/utils/latex_formatter.py`](src/utils/latex_formatter.py).
- **Streaming Responses & Loading Indicators:** Enhanced user experience with real-time streaming of AI responses and dynamic loading indicators (e.g., "ü§î Thinking...", "üóÑÔ∏è Querying the database...") during processing, implemented in the `stream_response` function in [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py).
- **Contextual Chat History:** Maintains conversation context for seamless interactions, managed within the Gradio interface logic.
- **Secure Configuration:** Manages sensitive credentials securely using environment variables (`.env`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python
- **Web Interface:** Gradio
- **AI Model Provider:** Nebius (specifically `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon)
- **Core Logic:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, custom AI model handlers.
- **Styling:** Custom CSS for a modern hospital theme.

## üì¶ MCP Tools/Servers

**üè∑Ô∏è Track 1: MCP Server / Tool**

This project implements a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Database Integration** to enable the AI assistant to interact with a live hospital database.

- **Core Engine:** The integration involves components like [`src/models/mcp_handler.py`](src/models/mcp_handler.py) and `src/services/advanced_database_mcp.py`.
  - **Intent Recognition:** The system parses user queries to determine if they relate to database information (e.g., patient lookup, room status).
  - **Data Retrieval & AI Analysis:** Instead of directly generating SQL and returning raw data, the system fetches data based on the user's intent. This data is then passed to the AI model along with the original user query. The AI analyzes the data, provides insights, and formats the response professionally. This flow is implemented in the `stream_response` and [`handle_ai_response`](src/components/interface.py) functions within [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py).
- **Seamless Chatbot Integration:** The main interface in [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py) automatically detects if a user's query should involve database interaction, fetches data, and then uses the AI to present a comprehensive, analyzed response.

## üì° MCP Server Configuration

This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configured for seamless integration and communication with clients supporting Server-Sent Events (SSE) and standard input/output (stdio).

## ü§ñ AI Agent

The primary AI agent powering the medical assistant is the **`meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`** model, accessed via the Nebius API.

- **Integration:** Managed through the [`NebiusModel`](src/models/nebius_model.py) class, which is initialized and used in [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py).
- **Capabilities:**
  - **Medical Consultation:** Answers health-related questions and provides medical information.
  - **Chat Completion:** Engages in natural conversations, maintaining context.
  - **Data Analysis & Presentation:** When provided with data from the hospital database (via the `stream_response` logic in [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py)), the AI analyzes this information in conjunction with the user's query. It then generates a comprehensive response including structured data, medical analysis, LaTeX formatting, and recommendations. This process is outlined in the `enhanced_prompt` logic within `stream_response` and [`handle_ai_response`](src/components/interface.py).
  - **Streaming Responses:** Supports streaming of responses for an interactive user experience.
- **Configuration:** Model parameters like temperature and max tokens are handled within the AI interaction functions in [`src/components/interface.py`](src/components/interface.py).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    - Copy `.env.template` to `.env`.
    - Fill in your `NEBIUS_API_KEY` and Neon database credentials (e.g., `NEON_HOST`, `NEON_DATABASE`, `NEON_USER`, `NEON_PASSWORD`) in the `.env` file.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

- **Development Server (with auto-reload):**
  ```bash
  python dev_server.py
  ```
- **Main Application:**
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
  Access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:7860` (or the port configured in [`.env`](.env)).

## üóÑÔ∏è Database

The application integrates with a Neon PostgreSQL database containing hospital data across tables like `users`, `patient_records`, `rooms`, `occupancy`, etc. This enables the AI to provide responses based on real-time information. Secure database configuration is handled via [`.env`](.env).



## ‚öôÔ∏è Future Enhancements

As we continue to evolve H.A.H.A, here are some of the key areas identified for improvement and expansion:

1. **Chat History Access:** Currently, there is no way to retrieve or access previous chat conversations. Adding persistent chat history for each session will enhance continuity and usability.
2. **CRUD Operations on Data Tables:** While users can view hospital data, the application does not yet support Create, Update, or Delete operations. Future updates will allow authorized users to directly modify hospital data.
3. **Improved Prediction Accuracy:** The prediction models used in the current version were optimized for performance due to time constraints. In future releases, we plan to enhance the models for better accuracy and robustness.
4. **Speech-to-Text Integration:** To improve accessibility and ease of use, especially for medical professionals in fast-paced environments, we plan to add voice command and speech-to-text capabilities.

# üè• Hospital Schema Context Injection Implementation

## Overview

This implementation successfully integrates the `hospital_schema_guide.md` document as context for the chatbot, enabling it to generate more accurate SQL queries and provide better medical assistance based on the hospital's database structure.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

### What Was Implemented

1. **Hospital Schema Loader** (`src/utils/schema_loader.py`)
   - Loads the hospital schema guide from `data/hospital_schema_guide.md`
   - Provides formatted context for different use cases:
     - SQL generation context
     - General medical context  
     - Query interpretation rules
   - Includes fallback schema if the guide file is unavailable

2. **Enhanced SQL Generation** (`src/models/nebius_model.py`)
   - Updated `generate_sql_query()` method to use hospital schema context by default
   - Incorporates query interpretation rules from the schema guide
   - Provides hospital-specific guidelines for SQL generation

3. **Improved Database MCP** (`src/services/advanced_database_mcp.py`)
   - Enhanced system prompt generation to include full hospital schema context
   - Better SQL generation with awareness of hospital-specific data relationships
   - Proper interpretation of ambiguous terms (e.g., "B+" as blood group vs blood inventory)

4. **Context Injection in Interface** (`src/components/interface.py`)
   - Automatically injects hospital schema context for non-database queries
   - Enhances general medical conversations with hospital data structure awareness
   - Maintains existing functionality while adding contextual understanding

5. **Core Inference Enhancement** (`src/core/infer.py`)
   - Updated medical system prompt to include hospital interpretation rules
   - Better understanding of hospital-specific terminology and data relationships

## üß™ Test Results

The implementation was verified with comprehensive tests:

```
‚úÖ Hospital schema guide loaded successfully (11,626 characters)
‚úÖ SQL generation correctly uses patient_records table for blood group queries  
‚úÖ Database MCP properly detects database queries and uses hospital context
‚úÖ Interface successfully injects hospital context for medical queries
```

### Example: Blood Group Query Interpretation

**Before Context Injection:**
- Ambiguous interpretation of "B+ patients"
- Might query wrong table or miss data relationships

**After Context Injection:**
- Correctly identifies `patient_records.blood_group` for patient blood types
- Distinguishes between patient blood groups and blood inventory
- Generates proper JOINs between `users` and `patient_records` tables

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT u.full_name, pr.date_of_birth, pr.blood_group
FROM users u
JOIN patient_records pr ON u.id = pr.user_id
WHERE pr.blood_group = 'B+' AND u.role = 'patient'
ORDER BY u.full_name
LIMIT 50;
```

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Schema Loading
- On startup, `HospitalSchemaLoader` loads the schema guide
- Content is cached in memory for efficient access
- Provides different formatted contexts for different use cases

### 2. SQL Query Generation Flow
```
User Query ‚Üí Database Detection ‚Üí Schema Context Injection ‚Üí 
Nebius Model + Hospital Context ‚Üí Enhanced SQL ‚Üí Execution
```

### 3. General Medical Query Flow
```
User Query ‚Üí Context Enhancement ‚Üí Hospital Schema Context + 
User Query ‚Üí Nebius Model ‚Üí Contextually Aware Response
```

## üìä Key Features

### Schema-Aware SQL Generation
- **Blood Group Queries**: Correctly uses `patient_records.blood_group`
- **Blood Inventory Queries**: Uses `hospital_inventory` with `item_type='blood_unit'`
- **Patient Data**: Always filters by `role='patient'` in users table
- **Room Assignments**: Proper JOINs across users ‚Üí patient_records ‚Üí occupancy ‚Üí rooms

### Enhanced Medical Understanding
- Context about hospital data structure in all medical responses
- Better interpretation of hospital-specific terminology
- Awareness of data relationships and constraints

### Fallback Support
- Graceful degradation if schema guide is unavailable
- Continues to function with basic schema knowledge
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## üõ†Ô∏è Files Modified

1. **New Files:**
   - `src/utils/schema_loader.py` - Hospital schema context loader
   - `test_hospital_context_injection.py` - Verification tests

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `src/models/nebius_model.py` - Enhanced SQL generation
   - `src/services/advanced_database_mcp.py` - Better system prompts
   - `src/components/interface.py` - Context injection for general queries
   - `src/core/infer.py` - Medical system prompt enhancement

## üéØ Benefits

### For SQL Generation
- ‚úÖ More accurate table selection
- ‚úÖ Proper JOIN relationships
- ‚úÖ Correct interpretation of ambiguous terms
- ‚úÖ Hospital-specific query patterns

### For Medical Assistance
- ‚úÖ Context-aware responses about hospital data
- ‚úÖ Better understanding of hospital operations
- ‚úÖ Consistent terminology and interpretations
- ‚úÖ Data-driven medical insights

### For Maintainability
- ‚úÖ Centralized schema knowledge
- ‚úÖ Easy to update schema information
- ‚úÖ Non-breaking implementation
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage

## üöÄ Usage

The context injection works automatically:

1. **For SQL Queries**: Just ask natural language questions about hospital data
   - "How many B+ patients do we have?"
   - "Show me available rooms"
   - "List patients in ICU"

2. **For Medical Questions**: Get hospital-context-aware responses
   - "What should I know about blood group data?"
   - "Explain patient room assignments"
   - "How does our inventory system work?"

## üîß Configuration

No additional configuration required. The system:
- Automatically loads the schema guide from `data/hospital_schema_guide.md`
- Provides fallback if the file is unavailable
- Works with existing API configurations

## üìà Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Dynamic schema reloading without restart
- Schema versioning support
- Custom schema sections for different specialties
- Performance optimization for large schema files

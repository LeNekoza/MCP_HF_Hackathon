# Analysis Integration Implementation Summary

## âœ… Successfully Implemented

The Hospital AI chatbot now supports analysis result integration with the following features:

### 1. **Analysis Service (`src/services/analysis_service.py`)**
- **Purpose**: Handles loading and processing of analysis result files
- **Key Features**:
  - Detects `@analysis` in user messages
  - Maps keywords to relevant analysis files
  - Formats analysis data for AI consumption
  - Processes complex queries with multiple analysis types

### 2. **File Mappings & Keywords**
```python
# 9 Analysis types supported:
- staffing_result.json (Staffing Forecast)
- staff_load_result.json (Staff Workload)
- average_los_result.json (Length of Stay)
- tool_utilisation_result.json (Tool Utilization)
- inventory_expiry_result.json (Inventory Expiry)
- census_forecast_result.json (Bed Census Forecast)
- admission_split_result.json (Elective vs Emergency)
- los_prediction_result.json (LOS Prediction)
- burn_rate_result.json (Consumption Forecast)
```

### 3. **Interface Integration (`src/components/interface.py`)**
- **Modified**: `handle_ai_response()` function
- **Priority**: Analysis queries processed before database queries
- **Token Allocation**: Increased to 2500 tokens for complex analysis data
- **Context Enhancement**: Skips hospital schema injection for analysis queries

### 4. **Smart Query Detection**
```python
# Examples that work:
"@analysis What is our staffing situation?"
"@analysis How are tools being utilized?"
"@analysis Which blood units are expiring?"
"@analysis What's the average length of stay?"
"@analysis How loaded are our staff members?"
```

### 5. **Data Processing Flow**

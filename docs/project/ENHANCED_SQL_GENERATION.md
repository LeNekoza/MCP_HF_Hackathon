# Enhanced SQL Generation with Nebius Model

## Overview

This enhancement upgrades your Hospital AI Helper to use the Nebius Llama 3.3 70B model for intelligent SQL generation, similar to Google Cloud's Gemini function calling approach but adapted for your current setup.

## Problem Solved

**Before**: Your model was good with basic data retrieval but failed on complex queries requiring JOINs and advanced SQL operations. When asked to "list out top 30 patients with all relevant info", it would provide generic patient scenarios instead of actual database records.

**After**: The model now uses intelligent SQL generation to handle complex queries with:
- Multi-table JOINs
- Advanced aggregations
- Dynamic query construction
- Proper relationship handling

## Key Improvements

### 1. Intelligent SQL Generation
Instead of hardcoded pattern matching, the system now uses your Nebius model to generate SQL queries dynamically based on:
- Database schema understanding
- Natural language query analysis
- Context-aware table relationships
- Proper JOIN operations

### 2. Enhanced Database Schema Awareness
The system provides detailed schema information to the model, including:
- Table structures and relationships
- Foreign key constraints
- Data types and constraints
- Best practices for queries

### 3. Robust Fallback System
- Primary: Nebius model-based SQL generation
- Fallback: Pattern-matching for basic queries
- Error handling: Graceful degradation

### 4. Specialized SQL Generation Method
Added `generate_sql_query()` method to the Nebius model specifically optimized for database queries with:
- Low temperature for deterministic results
- SQL-specific prompting
- Proper formatting expectations

## Architecture

```
User Query → Database Query Detection → Nebius SQL Generation → SQL Execution → Formatted Response
     ↓                    ↓                        ↓               ↓              ↓
"top 30 patients" → TRUE → Complex JOIN query → Execute → "Patient Information (30 found): ..."
```

### 3. `test_enhanced_sql_generation.py`
- Comprehensive test suite for the enhanced functionality

## Example Transformations

### Query: "list top 30 patients with all relevant info"

**Before (Pattern Matching)**:
```sql
-- Basic SELECT with minimal JOINs
SELECT * FROM patient_records LIMIT 30;
```

**After (Nebius-Generated)**:
```sql
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.full_name as patient_name,
    pr.date_of_birth,
    pr.gender,
    pr.blood_group,
    pr.medical_history,
    pr.allergies,
    r.room_number,
    r.room_type,
    o.assigned_at as admission_date,
    CASE 
        WHEN o.discharged_at IS NULL THEN 'Currently Admitted'
        ELSE 'Discharged'
    END as status
FROM users u
INNER JOIN patient_records pr ON u.id = pr.user_id
LEFT JOIN occupancy o ON pr.id = o.patient_id AND o.discharged_at IS NULL
LEFT JOIN rooms r ON o.room_id = r.id
WHERE u.role = 'patient'
ORDER BY u.full_name
LIMIT 30;
```

### Query: "show me patients currently in ICU rooms with their medical history"

**Before**: Would likely fail or return generic response

**After**: Generates complex query with proper JOINs:
```sql
SELECT 
    u.full_name as patient_name,
    pr.medical_history,
    pr.allergies,
    r.room_number,
    r.room_type,
    o.assigned_at
FROM users u
INNER JOIN patient_records pr ON u.id = pr.user_id
INNER JOIN occupancy o ON pr.id = o.patient_id AND o.discharged_at IS NULL
INNER JOIN rooms r ON o.room_id = r.id
WHERE u.role = 'patient' 
AND r.room_type = 'ICU'
ORDER BY r.room_number;
```

## How to Use

### 1. Test the Enhanced System
```bash
python test_enhanced_sql_generation.py
```

### 2. Try Complex Queries in Your App
- "list top 30 patients with all relevant info"
- "show me all patients currently in ICU with their medical history"
- "find nurses assigned to patients in room 101"
- "get equipment usage statistics by department"

### 3. Monitor the Logs
The system logs SQL generation process:
```
INFO: Generated SQL using Nebius: SELECT u.full_name...
DEBUG: Generated SQL: [full query]
```

## Benefits

1. **Intelligent Query Understanding**: Nebius model understands complex requests and generates appropriate SQL
2. **Proper JOIN Operations**: Automatically determines needed table relationships
3. **Context Awareness**: Uses database schema knowledge for better queries
4. **Fallback Safety**: Always has a working fallback if AI generation fails
5. **Maintainable**: Easy to extend with new query types without hardcoding patterns

## Configuration

Ensure your Nebius API key is configured:
```bash
export NEBIUS_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Or in `config/nebius_config.json`:
```json
{
  "api_key": "your-api-key-here"
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Function Calling Integration**: Add formal function calling structure similar to Gemini
2. **Query Optimization**: Add query performance analysis
3. **Schema Evolution**: Automatic schema updates and learning
4. **Multi-Database Support**: Extend to other database types
5. **Natural Language Explanations**: Explain generated queries to users

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Nebius API Not Available**: System automatically falls back to pattern matching
2. **SQL Syntax Errors**: Check database schema and logs for details
3. **No Results**: Verify database connectivity and data existence

### Debug Steps

1. Check Nebius model availability: `nebius_model.is_available()`
2. Review generated SQL in logs
3. Test SQL manually in database console
4. Verify database schema matches expectations

## Conclusion

This enhancement transforms your Hospital AI Helper from a pattern-matching system to an intelligent SQL generation system that can handle complex database queries with proper JOINs and advanced operations, similar to Google Cloud's approach but using your Nebius model.
